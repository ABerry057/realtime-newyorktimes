The New York Times provides publicly accessible APIs with the goal of encouraging innovation through crowdsourcing. The Times would 
like the general community of developers to help gain insight into how the dissemination of information can be reimagined. Additionally, 
giving the public access to their data is inline with their core journalistic values; to inform the public. The Times APIs will provide
data illuminating the titles and abstracts of the most popular articles over time.  This data can be leveraged to analyze and ultimately 
visualize the most popular topics in a given time period. Natural language processing will allow us to determine a topic area for an 
article and which keywords are most frequently used. By examining word choice in popular articles over time and visualizing this 
information via a Web App we will be able to identify trends over time and democratize this information to the public. 

More generally, we may also be able to determine what topics were salient in a given time period. By looking at the keywords we may 
also be able to determine news that was highly covered and saturated the percentage of all topics in the articles. For example in 2010, 
the Iraq war and Helmand province was highly covered. This information is particularly interesting because it can help readers understand 
which topics are highly covered, and which ones are glanced over and therefore signal what the New York Times deems as newsworthy.
